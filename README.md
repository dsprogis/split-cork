# split-cork
3D Printed Split Cord allowing electrical cable to pass through.
The stl file represents one half of the total cork - you will need to print two.
I use Cura into which you can import the file twice and print two at the same time.
If you plan to use this cork with or around alcohol, consider using PETG which seems to be stable based on Internet searches.
You may or may not chose to glue the two halves together for a complete seal.
You may or may not chose to simply use a little tape to make a temporary seal.
You may or may not chose to put a little tape on the electrical cable on top of the cork to prevent the cable from sliding inside the cork.
